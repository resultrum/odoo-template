# It is empty by default. Add OCA repositories as needed for your project.
#
# Format:
#   ./addons/oca/<repo-name>:     # Where to store the merged repo locally
#     remotes:
#       oca: <OCA-GITHUB-URL>     # Official OCA repository
#       resultrum: <FORK-URL>     # Your organization fork for customizations
#     merges:
#       - oca <branch>            # Base branch from OCA
#       - resultrum <branch>      # (Optional) Custom branch to merge on top
#     target: resultrum <branch>  # Where to push merged result
#
# Example (uncomment and customize):

# ./addons/oca/account-invoicing:
#   remotes:
#     oca: git@github.com:OCA/account-invoicing.git
#     resultrum: git@github.com:your-org/account-invoicing.git
